Student Name: Tuelo Munzhelele
Student Number: ST10480460
Institution: Rosebank College
Subject: Application Development
Language: TypeScript
Project: Final PoE
Project Overview
This TypeScript app allows a restaurant to manage its menu efficiently.
It includes separate screens for chefs and guests, displays menu information, and uses loops, functions, and arrays to organize and manage data.
Learning Outcomes
At the end of this project, I am able to:
Use a for loop, while loop, and for-in loop in TypeScript to solve programming problems.
Define and use functions to organize my code.
Work with global variables to store and access data.
Use arrays to manage and display menu items.
Refactor code into multiple files for better structure and readability.
Features Implemented
Part 2 Feedback Implemented
Fixed layout or logic issues mentioned by the lecturer.
Improved function naming and structure.
Updated comments and documentation.
Adjusted the user interface based on feedback.
New Features (Final PoE)
Average Price Display
The Home Screen now shows the average price of menu items grouped by course (Starters, Mains, Desserts, etc.).
Chef Management Screen
A new screen was added for the chef to:
Add new menu items.
Remove existing menu items.
Menu items are stored in an array.
Guest Filter Screen
A separate page was added for guests to filter menu items by course (for example, only view starters).
Refactoring and Code Improvements
The app was divided into multiple files (for example, main.ts, menu.ts, chef.ts, guest.ts).
Functions were used to handle actions like adding, deleting, and displaying menu items.
Variable names and structure were improved for readability.
